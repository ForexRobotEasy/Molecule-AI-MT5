# Molecule AI MT5

This code is part of the Molecule AI MT5 trading algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The algorithm is designed to analyze market trends using artificial intelligence and neural networks, and make trading decisions based on predefined criteria. It also includes risk management strategies, automated trade entry and exit, a user-friendly interface, and backtesting functionality.

## Libraries and Global Variables

The code includes the necessary libraries and defines global variables for trade management, mathematical calculations, neural network analysis, and data feed integration.

## Robust Order Execution System

The code includes functions to execute both market orders and pending orders. The `ExecuteMarketOrder` function takes the symbol, order type, and volume as parameters and executes the market order. The `ExecutePendingOrder` function takes the symbol, order type, volume, price, and slippage as parameters and executes the pending order.

## Risk Management

The code includes functions to calculate the stop loss level and take profit level based on risk percentage and risk-reward ratio. The `CalculateStopLoss` function takes the entry price and risk percentage as parameters and calculates the stop loss level. The `CalculateTakeProfit` function takes the entry price, risk percentage, and reward percentage as parameters and calculates the take profit level.

## Trade Opportunities

The code includes a function to identify trade opportunities based on predefined criteria. The `IdentifyTradeOpportunity` function contains the algorithm to identify these opportunities.

## Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks

The code includes a function to analyze market trends and make trading decisions using a neural network. The `AnalyzeMarketTrends` function calls the `AnalyzeMarketTrends` method of the `CNeuralNetwork` class.

## Data Feeds and Real-time Market Information

The code includes a function to integrate data feeds and retrieve real-time market information. The `RetrieveMarketInformation` function calls the `RetrieveMarketInformation` method of the `CDataFeed` class.

## Risk Management Strategies

The code includes functions to calculate position size based on risk percentage and account balance, and to control leverage based on predefined rules. The `CalculatePositionSize` function takes the risk percentage and account balance as parameters and calculates the position size. The `ControlLeverage` function takes the leverage as a parameter and sets the leverage using the `SetLeverage` method of the `CTrade` class.

## Automated Trade Entry and Exit

The code includes functions to enter and exit trades based on predefined rules. The `EnterTrade` function contains the algorithm to enter a trade, and the `ExitTrade` function contains the algorithm to exit a trade.

## User-friendly Interface

The code includes a function to configure and monitor the algorithm's performance. The `ConfigureAlgorithm` function contains the user interface code.

## Backtesting Functionality

The code includes a function to evaluate the algorithm's historical performance. The `EvaluatePerformance` function contains the backtesting code.

## Main Function

The `OnStart` function is the main function of the algorithm. It calls the necessary functions based on the required trade functions. In this code sample, it executes a market order, calculates the stop loss and take profit levels, identifies trade opportunities, analyzes market trends, retrieves market information, calculates the position size, controls leverage, enters a trade, exits a trade, configures the algorithm, and evaluates the performance.
